# Automated-Stock-Trader

The Automated Stock Trader is an algorithm-based trading platform created as a senior design project by three students at Purdue University. It provides two developer-created example algorithms as well as the option for a custom algorithm to be uploaded and the ability to run these algorithms on all stocks in the S&P 500. The stock trader currently runs on 1-minute stock data from 10/06/2022-02/02/2023.
